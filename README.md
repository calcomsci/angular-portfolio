# Angular Portfolio Welcome

Hello,
You are looking at the read me file of Hector De Perio's Angular Portfolio. <br />

## Development server <br />

I will keep this here as a reminder so you can clone the template yourself, if you wish. <br />

First off, you will need node.js installed to your system: node.js
You can follow the rest of the steps below once you have node.js installed.

To run this on a MacOS environment: <br />
1 Open Terminal <br />
2 Go to the directory where you cloned this repository. <br />
3 Type "sudo cd *insert directory of the cloned repository*" (for example: sudo cd /Users/devonly/Documents/angular\ template/angular/angular-folio) <br />
4 Ensure that Terminal shows that you are on the right directory where you cloned this repository (for example your Terminal should show devonly@MacBook-Pro angular-folio %) <br />

5 Type "sudo ng serve" on Terminal <br />
6 Type "local http://localhost:4200" if your browser doesn't automatically open it for you. <br />
7 That should be it. You have successfully cloned this repository <br />
