                <h3>A little more about me and this website:</h3>
                <p>My first programming language was C++. I think I first wrote a calculator program with it. I still use it today.</p>
                <p>Since 2021, I have dipped into front end software development, and learned Angular and React frameworks, along with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and the rest of the modern frontend package.</p>
                <p>This page was made in Angular, a Google service.</p>
                <p>I probably could have used React to make this portfolio and it would probably look the same.</p>
